# Cryptocurrencies

# Project Overview

- Create an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Specifically, create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a potential new investment. The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models, and since there is no known output for what the client is looking for we have to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm.

# Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
